# hello-world
My first github project!

My name is Aaron, I'm 22 and I love puzzles. To me, nothing is more satisfying than solving a problem and making something better. I think that's why I love computers so much, because they have so much potential to be better!

Among my hobbies are playing my matte black electric guitar, cooking for my wife, playing games with friends, drawing, and writing. I also love to be outdoors! Camping, hiking, kayaking, all that good stuff.

I hope to accomplish by the end of 2021 a functioning portfolio website that actually looks pretty snazzy, using my skills as a full stack web developer.
